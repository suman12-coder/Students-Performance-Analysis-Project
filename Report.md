# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Summary :
  - The analysis reveals a clear imbalance in student performance, with over 50% of students falling into the lowest grade category, indicating a significant at-risk population.

  - GPA distribution is moderately spread between 0 and 4, with most students clustered around the mid-range, validating GPA as a meaningful continuous performance indicator.

  - From the correlation analysis, Absences show a strong negative relationship with GPA and a strong positive relationship with lower GradeClass, making it the most influential negative factor. In contrast, Study Time Weekly has a positive relationship with GPA, confirming that consistent study habits improve academic outcomes.

 - Box plots and scatter plots demonstrate a clear separation of GPA across GradeClass levels, indicating that the target variable is well-defined and predictable.

 - Support-related factors such as Parental Support and Tutoring show a positive impact on GPA, while participation in extracurricular activities is associated with slightly higher academic performance, suggesting a balanced benefit rather than a distraction.

  - Overall, the dataset shows strong, logical relationships between academic behavior, support systems, and performance, making it well-suited for predictive modeling and early-intervention insights.
